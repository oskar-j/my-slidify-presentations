## Presentation agenda

1. How I gathered discussions from the GitHub,
2. Getting more insights into what's there,
  * global data and "private" chats from all over the world
  * calculated simple yet meaningfull statistics
3. The discussion network,
  * vaious definitions, multiple subnetworks, but same data
  * a true social network - people who spoke and/or coded together and/or follow each other..
4. What I found out, some results,
  * you will be the very first few in the world, to who I will present some interesting findings about utterances on the GitHub
5. Summary and Q&A time.

## Quiz

In which way would you describe the discussion dimension in the GitHub portal?

1. _A feedback mechanism, place for discussion, bug-list and task delegation, accessible through GitHub webpages. It is a dialogue between developers and/or users held under a code change, code integration or issue submission._
2. An exchange postbox, available as newsgroup protocol, created automaticly for every GitHub code repository, which you can add to e.g. Microsoft Outlook and automaticly get new messages.
3. Exchanging messages between programmers strictly through <i>git commit</i> messages and other git features like <i>git blame</i>.
4. None of those.

*** .hint

Programmers on GitHub discuss their work and ask for pull-requests (of code they created) with help of the GitHub web interface.

*** .explanation

**2nd** is incorrect, despite the fact you can get notifications on your e-mail about new comments, there is no such thing as a seperate newsgroup. **3rd** is incorrect - while of course proper title of the commit is an important part of communication inside the team, the main action is happening on the github pages, under particular commit / issue / pull request pages. **1st answer is correct**.

## Where discussion is taking place?

<div class='well'>
<p>Please visit this <b>'developer's manual'</b> for better insight:</p>
<p>https://developer.github.com/guides/working-with-comments/</p>
</div>
<div class='well'>
<p>If you are less familiar with GitHub, start with <b>'the guide':</b></p>
<p>https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#intro</p>
<p>It's also called "Hello World in 10 minutes"</p>
</div>

### What you need to know

* Discussion, same as wiki pages and README files, uses a Markdown syntax.
* It also have emoticons
* You can cite somebody or call him by login (with the '@' char)
* Keep in mind that discussion always occurs under a CHANGE or Integration Request (Pull Request) or Issue submission.

### Possible data-sources
Data acquisition. Hence **3** types of discussions: dialogue under issue/feature page, dialogue under a code commit, and a dialogue page under a pull request page. And you can get them from:

*** =left

**GitHub Archive**
- document-oriented JSON data
- document structure (MongoDB), vulnerable to constant change
- unlimited time periods and easy refill from the GitHub Archive (wget -> mongoimport)
- includes only a full body of *PullRequest* comment, rest of utterances one needs to download directly from the GitHub through web
- includes much more of *meta-information*!

*** =right

**GitHub Torrent**
- table-suctured relational data
- well structured - they're in defined MySQL database tables
- time period limited to the date of last SQL dumps
- includes the body (message) of only *PullRequest* comment and a *Commit* comment, body **is truncated to 256 chars** :(
- includes additional information about *timestamp, author, and commit id / pull request id*, but nothing more in particulat table..

### Possible data-sources (2)

For rapid data analysis, you can try using Google BigQuery, there is GitHub archive data already included in fast engine using propertiary BigQuery Language (BQL).

Alternativly, you can use GitHub Torrent mysql web-interface (console), but don't expect good relability neither performance..

<div class='well'>
<p>The best of course is using local copy of GHA / GHT data.</p>

## Creating discussion network

Data genesis

1. I made union of Commit Comments and Pull Request Comments in MySQL instance
2. Loaded into R and joined with GitHub users
   ```{r, eval=FALSE}
   dialogues_n_users <- sqldf("select d.*, u.login from dialogues d
                              join users u on d.user_id = u.id");
   ```
3. Count contributions per discussion page
   ```{r, eval=FALSE}
   aggregates <- sqldf("select commit_id, login, count(login) as n
                       from dialogues_n_users d group by commit_id, login");
   ```

---

## Creating discussion network (2)

4\. Count how many times users spoke with each other (under any discussion page - in whole GitHub)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
activity_network <- sqldf("SELECT a1.login as login1, a2.login as login2,
                              a1.n as c1, a2.n as c2
                              FROM aggregates a1
                              LEFT JOIN aggregates a2
                              ON a1.commit_id = a2.commit_id
                              WHERE a1.login < a2.login;")
network <- sqldf("SELECT login1, login2, count(*) as weight
                 from activity_network group by login1, login2")
network_matrix <- as.matrix(network)
```

## Network schema

* **Discussion** network

```{wolfram, echo=TRUE}
Graph[{B \[UndirectedEdge] A}]
```
<img width="410" height="114" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103068909/siec1.png"/>

* **Citing** network
* **Mentioning** network
* (both can be combined to one network)

```{wolfram, echo=TRUE}
Graph[{B \[DirectedEdge] A}]
```
<img width="410" height="114" src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103068909/siec2.png"/>

## Network properties

```{r, eval=FALSE}
> summary(dialogues_n_users)
```
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103068909/summary_dialogues.png" />
```{r, eval=FALSE}
> summary(network_matrix)
```
<img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/103068909/summary_matrix.png" />

## Network properties (2)

<div class='well'>
<p>Calculating any properties at all in a reasonable period of time was unreal. Even when using the cutoff parameter (where possible), I got nothing.</p>
</div>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(igraph)

mycutoff <- 3

betweenness(g, directed = FALSE, weights = E(g)$weight, normalized = FALSE)
edge.betweenness(g, directed = FALSE, weights = E(g)$weight)
betweenness.estimate(g, directed = FALSE, cutoff = mycutoff,
                     weights = E(g)$weight, nobigint = TRUE)

walktrap.community(g, weights = E(g)$weight, steps = 4, merges =
                      TRUE, modularity = TRUE, membership = TRUE)
fastgreedy.community(g, merges=TRUE, modularity=TRUE,
                     membership=TRUE, weights=E(g)$weight)
```

## (Smaller) sample discussion network

```{sql}
select * from project_members_with_owners pm join selected_repos sr on pm.repo_id = sr.repo_id;
```

---

## Swear words

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sqldf)
library(plyr)
library(rCharts)

swear_words <- read.csv("C:/big data/swearing.csv")
names(swear_words)[1] <- "entry"
swear_words$entry <- as.character(swear_words$entry)
swear_matched <- sqldf("select * from dialogues_n_users where body like '%" + famous_word + "%';")
short.date = strftime(swear_matched$created_at, "%Y/%m")
count_swear_dates <- count(short.date)

n1 <- rPlot(freq ~ x, data = count_swear_dates, type = "point")
```

---

## Swear words (2)

```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, comment = NA, results = "asis"}
load(file="swear_plot_obj.RData")
n1
```

---

## Multilayer analysis

1. muxViz - Visualization of interconnected multilayer networks
  * aditionaly allows to e.g. make multilayer centrality analysis etc.
2. Different algorithms for connecting layers
  * the most simple is (n-x/n)
  * it means edge in at least 2 layers of 3 is required
3. Possible to detect communities in such multilayered networks
